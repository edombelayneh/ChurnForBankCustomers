## Objective

Churn Prediction Dashboard is a web application designed to provide insights into customer churn probability. It utilizes machine learning model predictions to visually display churn probability using both a gauge chart and a model-based bar chart. This project was built using Streamlit and Plotly, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface for businesses to assess customer retention risks based on a variety of models like K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The dashboard is designed for businesses to make data-driven decisions by understanding their customer churn probability at a glance.
